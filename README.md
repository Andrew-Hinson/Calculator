# Calculator
Odin Project Calculator 
Guidelines for this project can be found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator

To Do: 
1. support for negative numbers
2. Decimal is not working after refactor, allows for more than one per number
3. Styling; responsive needs improvement, jumbled mess in mobile format, stretched too much in wide
4. Every now and then pressing enter returns blank screen.
5. Need to evaluate numbers and maybe give the power of so that the screen space is not taken up so much.
